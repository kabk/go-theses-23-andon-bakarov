			<p class="header">Intro</p>

			<p>
				A hungry bear does not dance (horo  ) is a notorious Bulgarian proverb, with an unclear origin to most who use it. Metaphorically the proverb translates to “А person will not complete his task, without the necessary salary”. Despite its humorous connotation, the expression is a literal description of its meaning, stemming from a humorless practice of public entertainment. Less than two decades ago, chained bears were roaming through the streets of Bulgaria’s cities and villages, walking on hind legs, accompanied by a musician playing a small traditional string instrument.			</p>

			<p>
				Bears have been tamed by humans from time immemorial in variety of cultures. Analysis of remains of a bear jawbone with peculiar deformation found at La Grande Rivoire rock shelter in France (1) suggests that bears were “tamed and tethered as early as 6.000 BC and possibly traveled alongside the early itinerant hunter-gatherer communities.  ” From the 12th century and for centuries, in Europe, bear trainers traveled through towns and villages with trained, muzzled, and chained bears.  Only until last century or two did the practice disappear from western countries, with the latest cases on the Balkans, Turkey, Russia and India.			</p>

			<p>
				People of the ethnic group Vlachs (Ursara  ), originating from Romania, were passing a tradition of bear training with generations, with the oldest records dating to the 13-14th centuries. Half nomads - traveling actively in summer through the Balkans and beyond, living in settlements during the winter. The Vlachs had their whole life dependent on an animal as all other people who nourished domesticated animals by means to place food on their table, with the difference that this one was not domestic but tamed. Nowadays, their descendants are mostly being generalized by the local population and media as Roma. 	
				
			<p>
				After the fall of Communism and the raise of democratic Bulgaria, the bears continued to dance, until 2002, when the career of bearmen got threatened by law prohibiting selling, buying, and exhibiting of brown bears in front of a paying public. This did not change the picture. The practice got attention by the Austrian organization Four Paws together with Brigitte Bardot Foundation got involved. Thanks to them, by 2007 all the dancing bears in Bulgaria have been bought from their keepers and relocated to a park next to Belitsa, specially built for them by the two organizations.
			
			<p>
				Why did an animal performer become problematic after years of restless practice? Many political, ethical, and ethnical factors played a role in the decision to remove the bears from the streets, that could be traced by digging the historical line of events. Although the more intimate and moral points of this relationship and the consequence in the human and animal individuals’ lives is what still seems to surface. 				

				<p class="header">1 Inflammation</p>


			<p>
There is a fine line between a living and dead body. Once there is a lack of movement, hunger, reaction, the absence of life surfaced. Pain is in the essence of the strive for living, readjusting the body to places that bring better conditions. “One can feel, therefore one lives. ”			</p>
			<p>
				Usually bought as small cubs from zoos with corrupted documents, or by some other bypass ways, the bears were rarely captured directly from their natural habitat. Doing so was considered heroic. While still small and innocent, the cubs got a ring inserted in their nose by piercing it with a heated metal bar. Compared to human beings, a bear’s smell sense is about 2100 to 3000 times better . By causing extreme pain, breaking teeth and cutting nails, the keepers ensured their control over the bear. The feeding of fear by physical harm, led to the dominance shifting form the physically stronger to the leader, keeping the wild animal buried. 	
			<p>
				There are different versions of the teaching process of the “dance”. The publicly presented version by some of the bear keepers is the humane training – by listening to the sound of the gadulka playing and rewarded by a treat when the movement was right. Such type of learned behavior is called “classical conditioning” – the same technique as teaching your dog to sit. Another, more brutal version, which is also mentioned in the Polish school for training bears for performing is the placement of the bear over a heated metal plate, with a simultaneous rhythm playing. The pain triggered the bear to rock back and forth on it’s legs, which was then reminded of by the sounds of the musical instrument. By the words of a biologist , however, bears are not capable of learning in this manner, instead another, simpler method was used. The chain was attached to the bear’s nose on one side and was ending in the hand of the person playing the instrument. The bear would try to keep up with the bow, creating the illusion of dancing to the rhythm of the music. Dancing was not an innate behavior, but an attempt to escape the pain. 	
			
				<p class="header">2	Commodity</p>

				<p>
					Hunger is the driving force of the leader’s action of capturing the bear, taming it and going out to beg for money. A hungry man makes a bear dance. The bear becomes a commodity, but at the same time is the one bringing the pleasure of full stomach. A dualistic view over the one in front, who is being a tool and a beloved child simultaneously. By John Berger’s words people living in dependency of their livestock, the animal is  “(…)subjected and worshipped, bred and sacrificed” with and separating the two. Most bear-man didn’t dream of making a living of a bear. Some inherited the practice as a family tradition, but others were led to this decision, by the absence of other choices for work. It must be said that the bear leaders would have benefited a different lifestyle if they’re ethnicity was on a different social status.			


				<p>
					However, once their bears were taken away from them, with the reason of providing “inhumane” conditions to their animals, all the bear leaders who gave interviews stated that the bear had a place in their family and was treated as such. There are several interviews available with Rady Ivanov (Baj Rady), known as the last living bear keeper in Bulgaria, from the village Yagoda. With their questions, the journalists take interest in the man's personal life, inquiring about his relationship with the bear he used to “own” and how his life changed since he lost his tool of making a living. Not a bear-man anymore, but a widower elderly man, living alone in a wrecked house, earning money by hand carving spoons. As he tells his nostalgic stories from the times when he used to walk with his bear on the shores of the Black Sea, he shows photos of him and Gosho (the bear). In one part of the interview, talking about his wife that passed away, he shows a photo that used to be on her tombstone – on the photo her standing along with the bear.

			<p>
				As in “a hungry bear does not dance” and many other sayings, an animal is used to represent a human condition, suggesting a reflection of the person’s own reality with the one in front. Such comparison is contradictory considering the usual anthropocentric and dominant position the human awards himself. The personification of the bear was a factor to the building of emotional bounding with the leader. The animal was treated as a person and therefore perceived as one. When asked if he tortured his bear, the answer was “I was not a torturer, whatever he wanted to eat and drink, he got”. This meaning that the diet of the bear was as human – including bread and alcohol daily.			</p>

		
			<p>
				One of the reason the dancing bear to be successful is its anthropomorphic figure. Man recognized himself in the figure standing on hind legs, but never to the point of full mirroring. The awareness of the difference in between makes the presence of human characteristics interesting and romantic. Such romanticized image of the animal is not connected to its essential being. As a bear could be seen as a part of the family, at the same time feared for its nature. The “dance” was the bait for the public. Without the public’s appreciation of such entertainment and payment, the practice wouldn’t continue.			</p>


			<p class="header">3	Reanimation</p>

			<p>
				“(…)sick with diabetes, cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, and cataracts.” is what remains after human contact. </p>

			<p>
				The remaining of the bear’s life is occupied with learning how to live like a bear and forget how to be a person. 
				The purpose of the park is the restoration of previously untapped natural instincts of bears by providing them an environment as close to their natural as possible. This requires a gradual presentation of the different spheres of freedom, by dosing. Slowly, the bears learn to search and find food, that was hidden for them. To socialize and build relationships with each other. Learn how to dig a hole in the ground and hibernate in it.
