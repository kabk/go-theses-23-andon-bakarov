<h3 class="chapters">INTRODUCTION – DANCING BEARS</h3>
			<p>
				A hungry bear does not dance horo (1) is a notorious Bulgarian proverb, with an unclear origin to most who use it. Metaphorically the proverb translates to “a person will not complete his task, without the necessary salary”. Despite its humorous connotation, the expression is a literal description of its meaning, stemming from a humorless practice of public entertainment. Less than two decades ago, chained bears were roaming through the streets of Bulgaria’s cities and villages, walking on hind legs, accompanied by a musician playing a small traditional string instrument (2)	</p>		
			
			<p>
				People of the ethnic group Vlachs  (Ursara ), also called мечкари/ мечкадари (bear-man), originating from Romania, were passing a tradition of bear training with generations, with the oldest records dating to the 13-14th centuries. Half nomads - traveling actively in summer through the Balkans and beyond, living in settlements during the winter. The Vlachs had their whole life dependent on an animal as everyone else who nourished domesticated livestock by means to place food on their table, with the difference that this one was not domestic but tamed.* Nowadays, their descendants are generalized by the local population and media as Romani, constituting Europe's densest minority. </p>

				After the fall of Communism and the raise of democratic Bulgaria, the bears continued to dance, until 2002, when the career of bearmen got threatened by law prohibiting selling, buying, and exhibiting of brown bears in front of a paying public.5 This did not change the picture. The practice got attention by the Austrian animal welfare organization Four Paws together with Brigitte Bardot Foundation who took the responsibility in their hand. With their hard effort, by 2007 all the dancing bears in Bulgaria have been bought from the bear leaders and relocated to a reserve park next to Belitsa (town in southwestern Bulgaria), specially built by the two organizations. Today, apart from being a touristic attraction, in the rehabilitation center 18 bears are living on 12 hectares, receiving medical care and constant surveillance.	</p>			
			<p>
				The Vlachs lived for centuries on Bulgarian lands. In different, invisible ways, they were integrated in the culture. Their image was built to be mystical, as a bait for the public, with legends built around the bear. Bulgarian folklore included beliefs related to the power of the bear. If a woman wanted children, she plucked a few hairs from a bear's stomach and tied them around her waist, with a black string for a boy and with a white string for a girl. The smoke from burning bear hair was believed to cure a variety of illnesses. (Ivanov 1984 ; Ivanova 1982 qtd. in Silverman, 1989)7 In some cases the bear would walk over an ill person or the ill person would be pulled through the bear's open mouth as a way of curing. Dressing up as a bear and leader at the Kukeri carnivals was typical.8 While the bears were dancing, the leaders sang songs on the streets and carnivals. The songs were traditional and well-known rural songs, original songs about the wars and domestic novellas, urban songs. The aim is to arouse listeners' attention and, on the group side, to satisfy the audience's taste.(Рашкова 1982, 1981)9 Although, the bears were the opposite of the promised majestic fairy figure – miserable, malnourished, skinny, small animals were the usual sight.</p>

<h3 class="chapters">TRANSITION</h3>

			<p class="first">
				“The first subject for painting was animal. Probably the first paint was animal blood. [...] it is not unreasonable to suppose that the first metaphor was animal.” (Berger)
				Animals have been the earliest subjects depicted by humans, and their interaction has been diverse and complex since prehistoric times. Humans have depended on animals for various purposes, and this dependence has persisted to this day. As human societies evolved and agricultural practices emerged, animals were domesticated for labor, food, and companionship. All these human-favored practices involved animal captivity.
				Bears have been tamed by humans from time immemorial in variety of cultures. Analysis of remains of a bear jawbone with peculiar deformation found at La Grande Rivoire rock shelter in France (fig.1) suggests that bears were “tamed and tethered as early as 6.000 BC and possibly traveled alongside the early itinerant hunter-gatherer communities. (Tünaydın)”
				The Roman Empire is well-known for its use of animals for entertainment. Emperors held gory spectacles in circular arenas in which animals fought to the death, either with each other or with human gladiators. (Linder) From the 12th century and for centuries, in Europe, bear trainers traveled through towns and villages with trained, muzzled, and chained bears. Only until last century or two did the practice disappear from western countries, with the latest cases on the Balkans, Turkey, Russia, and India. (Tünaydın)</p>
				<p>
				A crucial part of the story is the fact that a bear is not a domestic animal. "Tame" and "domesticated" are often used synonymously, but they have different meanings. "Domestication" is a process that leads to genetic changes in animal and plant populations, adjusting their wild ancestors to human needs, while "taming" is the process of habituating individual animals to humans, reducing their natural avoidance response, and allowing closer contact and handling. (Diamond)</p>
				<p>
					The bears in Bulgaria were usually bought for large sums as small cubs from zoos with corrupted documents, or by some other bypass ways, rarely captured directly from their natural habitat. Doing so was considered heroic. While still small and innocent, the cubs got a ring inserted in their nose by piercing it with a heated metal bar (Szabłowski). Compared to human beings, a bear’s smell sense is about 2100 to 3000 times better.12 By causing extreme pain, breaking teeth, and cutting nails, the keepers ensured their control over the bear. (Ibid.) </p>
				<p>
					Dancing was not an innate behavior. Such taming would never be possible without the use of tools of physical manipulation and the bear keepers in Bulgaria practiced the same. Physical harm was used in showing dominance and feeding fear, keeping the wild animal in submissive eness.</p>

			<p class="first">
				There are different versions of the teaching process of the “dance”. In the 17th century in the town of Smorgon (Belarus), existed a bear training school. Performers from around the world were taking their bears to “educate”. The described technique of teaching there was the placement of the bear over a heated metal plate, with a simultaneous rhythm playing. The pain triggered the bear to rock back and forth on its legs, which was then reminded of by the sounds of the musical instrument. 13 </p>
		
			<p>
				The publicly presented version by some of the bear keepers is the humane training – by listening to the sound of the gadulka playing and rewarded with a treat when the movement was right. Such type of learned behavior is called “classical conditioning” – the same technique as teaching a dog to sit.14 By the words of biologist Dimitar Ivanov15, however, bears are not capable of learning in this manner, instead another, simpler method was used. The person held the bow for his gadulka and held a wooden stick, attached to the chain, at the end of which was the bear’s nose. The bear would try to keep up with the bow, creating the illusion of dancing to the rhythm of the music. But in fact it was an attempt to get away from the pain. (Szabłowski)</p>

			<p>
				The zoo is a demonstration of the relations between human and animals, illustrating the built distance. As cities expanded, human social order established and boundaries between wild and urban, nature and culture redefined and proliferated, humans possessed a need to bring nature back to engage with it.16 </p>

			<p>
According to John Berger, the public zoo, the place where people go to meet, see, observe animals, is the monument of the impossibility of such encounters. “[…]an epitaph to a relationship which was as old as (hu)man.” He describes the captive animals in zoos as marginal. Inhabiting an artificial space, much like a theatre prop, trying to suggest something of animal’s original landscape, but providing the bare minimum of an environment in which they can exist. The cages being viewed as frames of the animal inside, often disappoint in not meeting the expectations of the original “reproductions”. Berger argues that animals became exoticized and remote by their withdraw from human’s daily life, being replaced by realistic toys and the reproduction of animal imagery. Being dependent and isolated, the animal’s gaze rarely encounters the humans gazing at them. The look that once played a crucial role in the development of human society and with which most lived with until less than century ago is now extinguished. </p>

		<h3 class="chapters">BIPEDAL SILHOUETTE</h3>

			<p>
				Most bear-man probably didn’t dream of making a living of a bear. Some inherited the practice as a family tradition, but others were led to this decision, by the shortage of other possibilities. After the fall of Communism, and transition to an open market system in the early 1990s, majority and minority populations suffered from unemployment, resulting in poverty mainly in the rural areas. The combination of the ethnical towards Romani and the economical state of the country, led to some believing that the taming of a bear could be a profitable move. Hunger is the driving force of the leader’s action of capturing the bear, taming it and using it for begging. The bear becomes a commodity, but at the same time is the one bringing the pleasure of a full stomach to its “owner”. </p>
			<p>
				However, once their bears were taken away, with the charge of providing “inhumane” conditions to their animals, the bear leaders who were interviewed stated that the bear had a place in their family and was treated as such. There are several interviews available with Rady Ivanov (Baj Rady), known as the last living bear keeper in Bulgaria, from the village Yagoda. With their questions, the journalists take interest in the man's personal life, inquiring about his relationship with the bear he used to “own” and how his life changed since he lost his tool of making a living. Not a bear-man anymore, but a widower elderly man, living alone in a wrecked house, earning money by hand carving spoons. It seems that the chain was tied both ways. The person was attached to the bear, as much as the other way around.
As he tells his nostalgic stories from the times when he used to walk with his bear on the shores of the Black Sea, he shows photos of him and Gosho (the bear). In one part of the interview, talking about his wife that passed away, he shows a photo that used to be on her tombstone – on the photo her standing along with the bear. 17A personal memorial, but also a metaphorical one of the death of the practice, where the bear and the man are still together. When asked if he tortured his bear, the answer was “I was not a torturer, whatever he wanted to eat and drink, he got”. This meaning that the diet of the bear was as the one of the human – including bread and alcohol daily.</p>

			<figcaption><p class="pfigure" width="400px">The photograph from the tombstone of Rady Ivanov’s wife next to Gosho</p></figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>
				This troubled relationship may have led to the owner’s denial of the bear’s otherness and not realizing the extent of the harm they posted on the animal. Even if some of the bear-men were not ill-tempered consciously, as Rady seems, their actions towards the animals were as evil. This could be observed in the later encounter between the same bear and leader described by Witold Szabłowski.
After a couple of years of the bear living in Belitsa, a foreign movie producer decides to take the man to see the bear. When he went next to the fence and threw a fruit, Gosho insisted to eat it. The other bears reacted and ate the other fruits, but the bear recognized his owner by the smell. For Rady it was an emotional experience. He called the bear as his child and couldn’t hold his tears. But Dimitar Ivanov speculates that the bear remembered how he was threated before he was allowed to eat food – he expected to be hit first. The bear in question has lost its vision during its life with the man, probably a result of the alcohol it received regularly and an accident it had, during the travels around the country. </p>

			<p>
				An old Ursara legend that used to be widespread in the past in the Balkans, but now is almost forgotten, infers the origin of the practice:</p>

				<p>
					"Once upon a time there was an honest girl, who became pregnant without having anything to do with a man. She was very miserable and went to the river to drown herself. When she reached the river, the water drew back, fleeing from her, so she could not get to it and jump in. Suddenly a man stepped out of the river and said, Girl, do not be sorry that you have conceived. You will give birth to an animal that will be capable of working like a man. The girl went back home and in due time gave birth to a bear. When the bear cub grew up, the Vlach Gypsies trained it to dance and to do various other things, and that's how they became bear-trainers and started to travel round the world leading bears." (Vukanović 1983:179-180) 18 </p>


			<p>The legend of the practice of dancing bears does not include the part where the animal is caught and perforated. Instead, the bear is a child, born by a human. But it's means to exist is to work. Hiding the fact of capturing the bear, but perceiving it as a man-made creature, emphasizes the perception of "owning" the bear. And because the bear is man-made, it is natural to act and live as a human. The animal was treated as a person and therefore perceived as one.</p>
			
			<p>“It is better to presume that boulder is a bear (and be wrong) than to presume that a bear is a boulder (and be wrong)”.(Guthrie)</p>

			<p>Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits and characteristics to non-human entities or events. This term comes from the Greek words "anthropos" meaning human and "morphe" meaning form. It is a common practice in our daily lives, in the arts, and even in scientific research, often unconsciously. Our desire to understand the world around us leads us to interpret it using the most familiar model available to us, that of human beings. However, the impulse to anthropomorphize is not about making the world more human-like, but rather about finding and emphasizing any human elements that may be present, whether they are actual humans, their messages or their traces. Due to the uncertainty inherent in our perceptions of the world, we tend to overestimate these human-like elements.(Guthrie, 1993)</p>
			<p>This anthropomorphic perception of animals provided hunter peoples with a conceptual framework that enables them to understand their prey, to identify with it, and to anticipate its behavior. On the other hand, it creates the following moral conflict: if the animal is considered an equal, then killing it is murder.20 </p>
			<p>Naturally, bears are capable of standing up on its hind legs. Doing so allows a bear to get more information from its senses of smell, sight, and hearing. It is a sign of curiosity, not aggression.21Their flat-footed stance makes it easy to stand up straight.
	Bipedalism being one of the most distinctive features of Hominids, possibly led the attention to the bear specie.</p>
			<p>If this reflexive consciousness (using self-knowledge of what it is like to be a human to understand the behavior of others) is used, than the action of misperception of the animal’s otherness might be due to the lack of understanding of the different nature of animals.</p>

		
<h3 class="chapters">OBJECTS</h3>
			
				<p>The perceptional distance between human and animal bodies I am interested into looking is captured in Jannis Kounellis’s work Untitled (12 horses). In 1967, the Greek-born artist arranged the tethering of a dozen of horses, facing the walls of a spacious Roman garage.23 What makes the artwork is the simple gesture of displacing that makes a differentiation from real life and gives reasons for speculations. What happens in the moment when an animal is positioned outside of the realm in which we are used to see it? The living bodies of the horses are shifting between being an artwork and being grotesquely real. The absurdism, the smells and beautiful figures, forces the viewers into facing what they do not want to see. In the moment when the body is presented as an object, the viewer realizes that it is not, and it’s rather closer to his own self. The displacement of the horses by putting them in a gallery context raises the question of objectification and the representation of non-human beings</p>

				<p>“Q: When is a sheep not a sheep? A: When it’s a work of art” - An example of the gap between the linguistic and the real in “The work of representation” by Stuart Hall. In the artwork, the sheep is preserved and “depicted” in the most literal form possible. Is a sheep, a sheep, when it is dead? The representation is as valid as it would be for a living animal. The physicality of the body holds within all of it’s essence.</p>

				<p>In Damien Hirst’s work “Away from the Flock, a sheep is floating in formaldehyde-filled tank. It is a sheep, but it’s not seen as the sheep it once was. simulacral objects, rather than preserved objects of nature itself.</p>

				<p>“Taxidermy then assumed the role of referent for a distant nature functioning as the still and silent token for the exotic and marvelous life forms that inhabited faraway lands — worlds admired and treasured as much as mystified and misunderstood…”</p>

				<p>Taxidermy26 is the process of preserving animal skin together with its feathers, fur, or scales. The taxidermist by various techniques re-animates the dead body. After removing the inner body parts, measuring them, and finding accurate replacements, an artefact is created, meant to reproduce the likeness of the living creature as accurate as possible. It is the taxidermist’s goal to rearticulate the animal into a ‘lifelike’ state and to therefore ‘re-create’ the essence of the once living creature. (Patchett).</p>

				<p>Although, by this reanimation, the captivity of the animal becomes double. With the intention of creating a ‘typical’ specimen27, the individual animal that has been skinned and stuffed and turned into taxidermy object, becoming a symbolic animal that is representative of the species. (Ibid) The body becomes a scientific information. By developing classical poses and standardized arrested-motion stances, became associated with different species of animal’ (Desmond 2002: 160). These arrested-motion poses suggest two levels of fixity: firstly they ‘capture, or rather index the now lost capacity of the (once living) animal to move’ and secondly, they fix the animal as an ‘exemplar’ of its species, leading to objectification.(Ibid) First the animal is objectified, by literally being turned into object, and secondly it’s own presence doesn’t resemble the individuality of the subject.</p>

				<p>Taxidermists from as far back as the 19th century sought to impart a ‘look of life’ into their mounts. (Ibid) A taxidermy model is authentic in that it is made of the skin of a once living animal, yet is deceptive, in that it is supposed to trick the viewer into believing that it is once again, or could be, animate.</p>

<h3 class="chapters">UNLEARNINIG (Rotting In The Free World)</h3>
				
				<p>“(…)sick with diabetes, cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, and cataracts.”</p>
				
				<p>Szabłowski describes in details the bear’s lives in Belitsa, after their captivity is over. The remaining of the bear’s life is occupied with learning how to live like a bear and unlearn how to be a person.
					The purpose of the park is the restoration of previously untapped natural instincts of bears by providing them an environment as close to their natural as possible. This requires a gradual presentation of the different spheres of freedom, by dosing. Slowly, the bears learn to search and find food, that was hidden for them. To socialize and build relationships with each other. Learn how to dig a hole in the ground and hibernate in it.
					What is freedom when you never had it? The bears, now recognized for their being, have to learn something that is supposedly natural.</p>
